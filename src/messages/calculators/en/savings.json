    { "question": "What's the difference between APR and APY?", "answer": "APR is the simple interest rate. APY includes compounding, showing what you actually earn. Always compare APY for savings accounts." },
    { "question": "How often should I contribute?", "answer": "More frequent contributions maximize compound growth. Monthly is ideal for most people, aligned with paychecks." },
    { "question": "Should I consider inflation?", "answer": "Yes! If inflation is 3% and your savings earn 2%, you're losing purchasing power. Aim for rates that beat inflation." }

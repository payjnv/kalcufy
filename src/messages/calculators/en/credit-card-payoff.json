    { "question": "Why does minimum payment take so long?", "answer": "Minimum payments are designed to maximize interest for the bank. Most of your payment goes to interest, barely touching the principal." },
    { "question": "Avalanche vs Snowball method?", "answer": "Avalanche pays highest interest first (saves most money). Snowball pays smallest balance first (psychological wins). Avalanche is mathematically optimal." },
    { "question": "Should I use savings to pay off debt?", "answer": "If your credit card APR is 20% and savings earn 2%, paying off debt is like earning 20% guaranteed. Keep a small emergency fund, then attack the debt." }

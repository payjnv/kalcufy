    "interestExplanation": {
      "title": "How Credit Card Interest Works",
      "content": "Credit card interest compounds daily, not monthly. Your APR is divided by 365 to get a daily rate, which is applied to your average daily balance. For example, at 22% APR, the daily rate is 0.0603%. On a $5,000 balance, you accrue about $3 in interest per day. This means delaying payments—even by a few days—costs real money. When you make a payment, it first covers accrued interest, then any fees, and finally reduces your principal. This is why minimum payments feel like they barely make a dent: most goes to interest, leaving only a small amount to reduce what you actually owe."

    "whyPayoffMatters": {
      "title": "Why Paying Off Credit Cards Matters",
      "content": "Credit card debt is one of the most expensive forms of borrowing, with average APRs exceeding 22% in 2025. Unlike mortgages or auto loans with fixed terms, credit cards have no set payoff date—making it easy to carry balances for years or decades. The longer you carry a balance, the more you pay in interest, which could have been invested or saved. Eliminating credit card debt frees up cash flow for emergency savings, retirement contributions, and other financial goals. It also improves your credit utilization ratio, potentially boosting your credit score."
    },
    "buildingGoodHabits": {
      "title": "Building Credit Card Habits That Stick",
      "content": "Once you pay off your credit cards, prevent future debt by treating them like debit cards—only charge what you can pay in full each month. Set up autopay for the full balance to avoid interest entirely. Use your cards for rewards and purchase protection, but never carry a balance. If you struggle with overspending, consider using cash or a debit card for discretionary purchases. Finally, build an emergency fund of 3-6 months expenses so unexpected costs don't force you back into credit card debt."

  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": {
      "0": {
        "question": "Which is better: debt snowball or debt avalanche?",
        "answer": "Mathematically, the avalanche method (paying highest APR first) saves more money. However, research shows many people are more successful with the snowball method because paying off smaller balances quickly provides psychological wins that maintain motivation. Choose avalanche if you're disciplined and motivated by saving money. Choose snowball if you need quick wins to stay on track. The best method is the one you'll stick with."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "How is minimum payment calculated on credit cards?",
        "answer": "Most credit card companies calculate minimum payment as 2-3% of your balance OR a flat amount ($25-$35), whichever is greater. Some calculate 1% of balance plus all interest and fees. For example, on a $5,000 balance, the minimum is typically $100-$150. Check your card agreement for the exact formula. Warning: Paying only minimums can take 20+ years to pay off a balance."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "Should I do a balance transfer to a 0% APR card?",
        "answer": "A balance transfer can save significant money if: (1) You have good credit to qualify (usually 670+), (2) You can pay off the balance before the intro period ends (typically 12-21 months), (3) The 3-5% transfer fee is less than the interest you'd otherwise pay. For example, transferring $5,000 at a 3% fee costs $150, but saves $900+ in interest over 15 months at 22% APR. However, if you can't pay off before the promo ends, the regular APR (often 20%+) kicks in on any remaining balance."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "How much extra should I pay to make a real difference?",
        "answer": "Even $25-50 extra per month makes a significant difference. On a $5,000 balance at 22% APR: paying only minimums takes 27 years and costs $9,200 total. Adding just $50/month reduces this to 43 months and $6,400 total—saving $2,800 and 24 years! Adding $100/month further reduces it to 29 months and $5,800. The key is consistency: any extra amount, paid every month, compounds to massive savings."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "Should I save money or pay off credit cards first?",
        "answer": "Generally, pay off high-interest credit card debt first—it's hard to earn 20%+ returns investing. However, build a small emergency fund of $500-$1,000 first. Without this cushion, any unexpected expense forces you back onto credit cards. Once you have a mini emergency fund, aggressively pay down cards. After cards are paid off, build a full 3-6 month emergency fund."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "What happens if I miss a credit card payment?",
        "answer": "Missing a payment triggers multiple consequences: (1) Late fee of $25-$40, (2) Penalty APR of up to 29.99% may apply to your entire balance, (3) After 30 days late, it's reported to credit bureaus and damages your score, (4) After 60 days, penalty APR definitely applies, (5) After 180 days, your account may be charged off and sold to collections. Always pay at least the minimum on time. If you can't afford it, call your card issuer to discuss hardship options before missing the payment."

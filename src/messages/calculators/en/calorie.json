    { "question": "Should I eat back exercise calories?", "answer": "For weight loss, eat about half of exercise calories. Exercise trackers often overestimate calories burned." },
    { "question": "Why is my maintenance so high/low?", "answer": "Maintenance varies widely based on height, weight, age, and especially activity level. More muscle also increases metabolism." }

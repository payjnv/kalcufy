    {
      "question": "What is body fat percentage?",
      "answer": "Body fat percentage is the total mass of fat divided by total body mass, multiplied by 100. It includes essential fat (necessary for life) and storage fat. A healthy body fat percentage varies by gender, age, and fitness level."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which method is most accurate?",
      "answer": "The Navy Method using body measurements is generally most accurate for the average person without specialized equipment. For athletes with low body fat, the Army method may be more accurate. The BMI method is least accurate but requires no measurements."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure my waist correctly?",
      "answer": "For men: Measure at the navel (belly button) level. For women: Measure at the narrowest point of your waist, usually just above the belly button. Keep the tape horizontal and snug but not compressing the skin."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure my neck correctly?",
      "answer": "Measure around your neck just below the larynx (Adam's apple) with the tape sloping slightly downward at the front. Keep your head straight and look forward during measurement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a healthy body fat percentage?",
      "answer": "For men, 14-17% is considered 'fitness' level, while 18-24% is 'average'. For women, 21-24% is 'fitness' level, while 25-31% is 'average'. Athletes typically have lower percentages: 6-13% for men and 14-20% for women."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I measure body fat?",
      "answer": "Measure once every 2-4 weeks at the same time of day (preferably morning before eating) for consistent results. Body fat changes slowly, so daily measurements are unnecessary and may show misleading fluctuations."

      "title": "What is BMI?",
      "content": "Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical value calculated from your weight and height. Developed by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet in the 1830s, it provides a simple way to categorize individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. While not a direct measure of body fat, BMI correlates with more accurate measures and is widely used as a quick screening tool for potential health issues."
    },
    "bmiHealth": {
      "title": "BMI and Health Risks",
      "content": "Research shows that both very low and very high BMI values are associated with increased health risks. A BMI under 18.5 may indicate malnutrition or other health issues, while a BMI over 25 is associated with increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain cancers. However, BMI is just one factor - lifestyle, diet, physical activity, and genetics all play important roles in overall health."

    "beyondBMI": {
      "title": "Beyond BMI: Other Health Metrics",
      "content": "While BMI is useful, it has limitations. Consider complementing it with waist circumference (men >40\", women >35\" indicates higher risk), waist-to-hip ratio, body fat percentage measurements, and blood pressure/cholesterol levels. These provide a more complete picture of metabolic health than BMI alone."

  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": {
      "0": {
        "question": "What is a healthy BMI?",
        "answer": "A healthy BMI is generally considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9. This range is associated with the lowest health risks for most adults. However, optimal BMI can vary based on age, ethnicity, and individual factors."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "Is BMI accurate for athletes?",
        "answer": "BMI may not be accurate for athletes or highly muscular individuals. Since muscle is denser than fat, athletic people may have a high BMI despite having low body fat. In these cases, body fat percentage or other measurements are more reliable."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "Does BMI apply to children?",
        "answer": "Children and teens use BMI-for-age percentiles rather than standard adult categories. A child's BMI is compared to others of the same age and sex because body composition varies as children grow."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "Can I have a normal BMI but still be unhealthy?",
        "answer": "Yes, this is sometimes called 'skinny fat' or metabolically obese normal weight (MONW). You can have normal weight but high body fat percentage, especially around the organs. Regular exercise and a balanced diet are important regardless of BMI."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "How often should I check my BMI?",
        "answer": "For most adults, checking BMI a few times per year is sufficient. More frequent monitoring may be helpful if you're actively trying to lose or gain weight. Focus on long-term trends rather than daily fluctuations."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "What's the difference between BMI and body fat percentage?",
        "answer": "BMI is calculated from height and weight only, while body fat percentage directly measures the proportion of your body that is fat tissue. Body fat percentage is more accurate but requires special equipment like calipers, bioelectrical impedance scales, or DEXA scans."

    { "question": "How accurate is BMI?", "answer": "BMI is a useful screening tool but has limitations. It may overestimate body fat in athletes and underestimate it in older adults who have lost muscle mass." },
    { "question": "What's a healthy BMI?", "answer": "A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy for most adults. However, optimal weight can vary based on age, gender, and body composition." },
    { "question": "Should I only rely on BMI?", "answer": "No. BMI should be one of several health indicators. Consider waist circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels too." }

      "title": "What is a Percentage?",
      "content": "A percentage is a way to express a number as a fraction of 100. The word comes from the Latin 'per centum', meaning 'by the hundred'. When you see 25%, it means 25 out of every 100, or simply 25/100 = 0.25. Percentages are incredibly useful because they allow us to compare different quantities on a common scale, regardless of their absolute values. For example, saying 'sales increased by 15%' is more meaningful than saying 'sales increased by $150' because it gives context relative to the original amount."

Understanding percentages helps you make informed financial decisions, understand data and statistics, and solve everyday problems efficiently."

      "title": "Mental Math Tips",
      "content": "Here are quick mental math tricks for percentages: 10% = move decimal one place left (10% of 80 = 8). 5% = half of 10% (5% of 80 = 4). 1% = move decimal two places left (1% of 80 = 0.80). For 15%, calculate 10% + 5%. For 25%, divide by 4. For 50%, divide by 2. For 75%, calculate 50% + 25%. A useful trick: X% of Y = Y% of X (so 8% of 50 = 50% of 8 = 4)."

      "answer": "To find X% of Y, convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100, then multiply by the number. For example, 25% of 200 = (25/100) × 200 = 0.25 × 200 = 50."
    },
    "increaseDecrease": {
      "question": "How do I calculate percentage increase or decrease?",
      "answer": "Percentage change = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) × 100. If the result is positive, it's an increase; if negative, it's a decrease. For example, going from 100 to 125 is a 25% increase: ((125-100)/100) × 100 = 25%."
    },
    "whyNotEqual": {
      "question": "Why doesn't a 50% increase followed by a 50% decrease equal the original?",
      "answer": "Because the percentages are calculated from different base values. If 100 increases by 50%, you get 150. If 150 decreases by 50%, you lose 75 (50% of 150), leaving you with 75 - not 100. This is a common mathematical misconception."

    "conversions": {
      "question": "How do I convert between percentages, decimals, and fractions?",
      "answer": "Percentage to decimal: divide by 100 (25% = 0.25). Decimal to percentage: multiply by 100 (0.25 = 25%). Percentage to fraction: put over 100 and simplify (25% = 25/100 = 1/4). Fraction to percentage: divide numerator by denominator, multiply by 100 (1/4 = 0.25 × 100 = 25%)."

    "originalPrice": {
      "question": "How do I calculate the original price before a discount?",

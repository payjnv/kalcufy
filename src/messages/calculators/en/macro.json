      "question": "What are macros?",
      "answer": "Macros (macronutrients) are the three main nutrients that provide calories: protein (4 cal/g), carbohydrates (4 cal/g), and fat (9 cal/g). Tracking macros helps ensure you're getting the right balance for your goals."

      "question": "How much protein do I need?",
      "answer": "General recommendations: 0.8g/kg for sedentary adults, 1.2-1.7g/kg for active individuals, 1.6-2.2g/kg for muscle building, and 2.0-2.4g/kg during aggressive fat loss to preserve muscle."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I count fiber separately?",
      "answer": "Fiber is a type of carbohydrate, so it's included in your carb total. However, tracking fiber separately helps ensure you're getting enough (25-38g daily) for digestive health."

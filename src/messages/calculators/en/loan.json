  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What credit score do I need for a personal loan?",
      "answer": "Most lenders prefer a credit score of 670 or higher for the best rates. However, some lenders offer loans to borrowers with scores as low as 580, though at higher interest rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between APR and interest rate?",
      "answer": "Interest rate is the cost of borrowing the principal. APR includes the interest rate plus any fees, giving you the true cost of the loan. Always compare APRs when shopping."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I pay off my loan early?",
      "answer": "If your loan has no prepayment penalty, paying extra can save you significant money on interest. Even small extra payments add up over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Fixed vs variable rate - which is better?",
      "answer": "Fixed rates offer predictable payments. Variable rates may start lower but can increase. Fixed is usually better for longer-term loans."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do origination fees work?",
      "answer": "Origination fees (typically 1-8%) are charged by lenders to process your loan. They're usually deducted from your loan amount."

    "p2": "Your BMR accounts for approximately 60-75% of your total daily calorie expenditure. The remaining calories are burned through physical activity (15-30%) and the thermic effect of food (10%).",
    "p3": "Understanding your BMR is crucial for setting appropriate calorie goals, whether you want to lose weight, maintain your current weight, or build muscle.",

    {
      "question": "What is BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)?",
      "answer": "BMR is the number of calories your body needs to maintain basic life-sustaining functions like breathing, circulation, cell production, and nutrient processing while at complete rest. It represents about 60-75% of your total daily calorie expenditure."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between BMR and TDEE?",
      "answer": "BMR is calories burned at complete rest, while TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) includes BMR plus calories burned through daily activities and exercise. TDEE = BMR × Activity Factor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which BMR formula is most accurate?",
      "answer": "The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is considered most accurate for the general population. However, if you know your body fat percentage, the Katch-McArdle formula may be more precise as it accounts for lean body mass."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does pregnancy affect BMR?",
      "answer": "During pregnancy, your body requires additional energy to support fetal development, increased blood volume, and metabolic changes. The second trimester requires about 340 extra calories/day, and the third trimester about 450 extra calories/day."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does age affect BMR?",
      "answer": "BMR typically decreases by about 1-2% per decade after age 20, primarily due to loss of muscle mass. Maintaining muscle through exercise can help slow this decline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I increase my BMR?",
      "answer": "Yes! Building muscle mass through strength training is the most effective way to increase BMR, as muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue. Staying hydrated and getting adequate sleep also support healthy metabolism."

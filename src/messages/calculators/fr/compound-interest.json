Unlike simple interest (which is only calculated on the principal), compound interest creates a \"snowball effect\" where your earnings generate their own earnings."

    {
      "question": "What is compound interest?",
      "answer": "Compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. This creates a snowball effect where your money grows faster over time, making it a powerful tool for building wealth."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is compound interest different from simple interest?",
      "answer": "Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount, while compound interest is calculated on the principal plus any interest already earned. Over long periods, compound interest results in significantly higher returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Rule of 72?",
      "answer": "The Rule of 72 is a quick way to estimate how long it takes to double your money. Simply divide 72 by your interest rate to get the approximate years needed. At 7%, it takes about 10 years; at 10%, about 7 years."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does compounding frequency matter?",
      "answer": "Yes! More frequent compounding leads to higher returns. Daily compounding yields more than monthly, which yields more than annually. However, the difference is often small for typical savings rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does contribution timing matter?",
      "answer": "Contributing at the beginning of each period (annuity due) earns slightly more than contributing at the end (ordinary annuity), because your money has more time to compound. Over decades, this can add up to thousands of dollars."

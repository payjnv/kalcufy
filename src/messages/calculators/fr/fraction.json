      "content": "A fraction represents a part of a whole. It consists of two numbers: the numerator (top number) shows how many parts we have, and the denominator (bottom number) shows how many equal parts the whole is divided into. For example, 3/4 means 3 parts out of 4 equal parts. Fractions can be proper (numerator < denominator, like 2/3), improper (numerator ≥ denominator, like 5/3), or mixed numbers (whole number + proper fraction, like 1 2/3)."

    "findingLCD": {
      "title": "Finding the Least Common Denominator (LCD)",
      "content": "The LCD is the smallest number that both denominators divide into evenly. To find it: 1) List multiples of each denominator, 2) Find the smallest common multiple. For example, for 3 and 4: multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12...; multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12... The LCD is 12. Alternatively, you can use prime factorization or simply multiply the denominators (though this may not give the LCD, it will give A common denominator)."

      "title": "Simplifying Fractions",
      "content": "To simplify (or reduce) a fraction, divide both numerator and denominator by their Greatest Common Factor (GCF). For example, to simplify 8/12: GCF of 8 and 12 is 4, so 8÷4/12÷4 = 2/3. A fraction is in lowest terms when the GCF of numerator and denominator is 1. You can find the GCF by listing factors of both numbers and finding the largest common one, or by using prime factorization."

  "faqs": {
    "addDifferentDenominators": {
      "question": "How do I add fractions with different denominators?",
      "answer": "First, find the Least Common Denominator (LCD) of both fractions. Convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with the LCD as denominator. Then add the numerators and keep the common denominator. Finally, simplify if possible. Example: 1/3 + 1/4 → LCD is 12 → 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12."
    },
    "multiplyFractions": {
      "question": "How do I multiply fractions?",
      "answer": "Multiplying fractions is straightforward: multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator, multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator. No common denominator needed! Then simplify. Example: 2/3 × 4/5 = (2×4)/(3×5) = 8/15."
    },
    "divideFractions": {
      "question": "How do I divide fractions?",
      "answer": "To divide fractions, flip the second fraction (find its reciprocal) and multiply. This is often remembered as 'Keep, Change, Flip'. Example: 1/2 ÷ 3/4 = 1/2 × 4/3 = 4/6 = 2/3."

    "mixedToImproper": {
      "question": "How do I convert a mixed number to an improper fraction?",
      "answer": "Multiply the whole number by the denominator, add the numerator, and put the result over the original denominator. Example: 2 3/4 → (2×4)+3 = 11, so 2 3/4 = 11/4."
    },
    "improperToMixed": {
      "question": "How do I convert an improper fraction to a mixed number?",
      "answer": "Divide the numerator by the denominator. The quotient is the whole number, and the remainder is the new numerator over the original denominator. Example: 11/4 → 11÷4 = 2 remainder 3, so 11/4 = 2 3/4."

    "whatIsGCF": {
      "question": "What is the GCF and how do I find it?",
      "answer": "GCF (Greatest Common Factor) is the largest number that divides evenly into both numbers. To find it, list all factors of each number and find the largest one they share. For 12 and 8: factors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12; factors of 8 are 1,2,4,8. Common factors: 1,2,4. GCF = 4."

    "title": "What is a Mortgage?",
    "content1": "A mortgage is a loan used to purchase or maintain a home, land, or other types of real estate. The borrower agrees to pay the lender over time, typically in a series of regular payments divided into principal and interest. The property serves as collateral to secure the loan.",
    "content2": "Most mortgages are \"amortizing,\" meaning each payment covers both interest and principal. Early payments are mostly interest; later payments are mostly principal. Understanding this helps you make smarter decisions about extra payments and refinancing.",

  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much house can I afford?",
      "answer": "A common guideline is that your monthly housing costs (including mortgage, taxes, insurance) should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income. Lenders also look at your total debt-to-income ratio, which should typically be below 36%."
    },
    {
      "question": "What credit score do I need for a mortgage?",
      "answer": "For conventional loans, you typically need a credit score of at least 620. FHA loans may accept scores as low as 500 with a 10% down payment, or 580 with 3.5% down. Higher scores get better interest rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is PMI and how can I avoid it?",
      "answer": "Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) protects the lender if you default. It's required when you put less than 20% down. You can avoid it by making a 20% down payment, using a piggyback loan, or choosing a lender-paid PMI option."
    },
    {
      "question": "Fixed vs adjustable rate - which is better?",
      "answer": "Fixed rates offer payment stability and are better if you plan to stay long-term or rates are low. ARMs start lower and may be better if you plan to sell or refinance within 5-7 years, or if rates are expected to drop."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I pay points to lower my rate?",
      "answer": "Paying points (prepaid interest) can lower your rate, but it takes time to break even. Divide the cost of points by monthly savings to find your break-even point. If you plan to stay longer than that, points may be worth it."

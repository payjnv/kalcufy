However, IBW formulas were originally developed for calculating medication dosages, not for determining aesthetic or fitness goals.",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How accurate are ideal weight formulas?",
      "answer": "These formulas provide estimates based on height and gender. They don't account for muscle mass, bone density, or body composition. Use them as general guidelines, not absolute targets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do different formulas give different results?",
      "answer": "Each formula was developed for different purposes and populations. Robinson and Miller modified Devine's original formula. The variation gives you a healthy range to consider."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is frame size and why does it matter?",
      "answer": "Frame size refers to your bone structure (small, medium, large). People with larger frames naturally weigh more due to bigger bones. Wrist circumference is a simple way to estimate frame size."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should athletes use these formulas?",
      "answer": "Athletes with significant muscle mass may exceed these ideal weights while being perfectly healthy. Consider using body fat percentage instead for a more accurate assessment."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's a safe rate of weight loss?",
      "answer": "Most health experts recommend 0.5-2 lbs (0.25-1 kg) per week. Faster weight loss can lead to muscle loss, nutritional deficiencies, and is harder to maintain long-term."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I measure my wrist for frame size?",
      "answer": "Wrap a measuring tape around your wrist just below the wrist bone (where you'd wear a watch). Keep the tape snug but not tight. Compare to the thresholds for your gender."

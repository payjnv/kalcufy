      {
        "title": "How Loan Payments Work",
        "content": "Each loan payment consists of two parts: principal and interest. At the beginning of the loan, most of your payment goes toward interest. Over time, more goes toward principal. This is called amortization."

      {
        "title": "APR vs Interest Rate",
        "content": "The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) includes the interest rate plus other fees and costs, giving you a more complete picture of what the loan will cost. Always compare loans using APR rather than just the interest rate."
      },
      {
        "title": "Impact of Loan Term",
        "content": "A longer loan term means lower monthly payments but more total interest paid. A shorter term has higher payments but saves money on interest. Choose based on your budget and financial goals."
      },
      {
        "title": "Benefits of Extra Payments",
        "content": "Making extra payments, even small ones, can significantly reduce total interest and shorten your loan term. Extra payments go directly toward principal, reducing the balance that accrues interest."

  "faq": {
    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How is my monthly payment calculated?",
        "answer": "Monthly payment is calculated using the loan amount, interest rate, and term. The formula accounts for compound interest to ensure each payment covers both interest charges and reduces your principal balance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I pay off my loan early?",
        "answer": "Paying off a loan early saves money on interest, but check for prepayment penalties first. Also consider whether you could earn more by investing extra funds instead of paying down low-interest debt."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between secured and unsecured loans?",
        "answer": "Secured loans are backed by collateral (like a car or home), typically offering lower interest rates. Unsecured loans don't require collateral but usually have higher rates because they're riskier for lenders."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does my credit score affect my loan?",
        "answer": "Your credit score significantly impacts the interest rate you'll receive. Higher scores typically qualify for lower rates, potentially saving thousands over the life of the loan. Even a 1% rate difference can be significant."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if I miss a payment?",
        "answer": "Missing a payment can result in late fees, damage to your credit score, and potentially higher interest rates. If you're struggling, contact your lender about hardship programs or modified payment plans before missing payments."

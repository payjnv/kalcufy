        "title": "How Mortgages Work",
        "content": "A mortgage is a loan used to purchase a home. You borrow money from a lender and pay it back over time with interest. Each monthly payment includes both principal (the amount borrowed) and interest (the cost of borrowing)."
      },
      {
        "title": "Fixed vs. Adjustable Rate",
        "content": "Fixed-rate mortgages have the same interest rate for the entire loan term, providing predictable payments. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have rates that can change after an initial fixed period, which may result in lower initial payments but more uncertainty."
      },
      {
        "title": "The Importance of Down Payment",
        "content": "A larger down payment reduces your loan amount, monthly payments, and total interest paid. With 20% or more down, you can avoid PMI, saving hundreds per month. However, putting too much down can deplete your emergency fund."
      },
      {
        "title": "Understanding PMI",
        "content": "Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) is required when your down payment is less than 20%. It protects the lender if you default. PMI typically costs 0.5-1% of the loan amount annually and can be removed once you have 20% equity."

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",

      {
        "question": "How much house can I afford?",
        "answer": "A common guideline is that your monthly housing costs (including mortgage, taxes, and insurance) shouldn't exceed 28% of your gross monthly income. Your total debt payments shouldn't exceed 36% of your income."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I choose a 15-year or 30-year mortgage?",
        "answer": "A 15-year mortgage has higher monthly payments but saves significant money on interest and builds equity faster. A 30-year mortgage has lower payments, providing more flexibility, but costs more in total interest over the life of the loan."
      },
      {
        "question": "What credit score do I need for a mortgage?",
        "answer": "Most conventional loans require a credit score of 620 or higher. FHA loans may accept scores as low as 580 with a 3.5% down payment. Better credit scores typically qualify for lower interest rates, saving thousands over the loan term."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I pay points to lower my rate?",
        "answer": "Mortgage points let you pay upfront to reduce your interest rate. Each point costs 1% of the loan and typically reduces the rate by 0.25%. Points make sense if you plan to stay in the home long enough to recoup the cost through lower payments."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's included in my monthly payment?",
        "answer": "Your monthly mortgage payment typically includes principal, interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and possibly PMI and HOA fees. This is often called PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes, Insurance)."

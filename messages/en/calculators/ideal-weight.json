        "title": "What is Ideal Body Weight?",
        "content": "Ideal body weight (IBW) is a weight that is believed to be maximally healthy for a person, based on height. It is used in medicine as a reference for drug dosage calculations and as a general health guideline."
      },
      "formulas": {
        "title": "The Formulas Explained",
        "content": "We use four scientifically validated formulas to calculate ideal weight. The Devine formula (1974) is most commonly used in clinical settings. Robinson and Miller formulas (1983) are modifications that account for different body compositions. The Hamwi formula (1964) is the original calculation method."

      "limitations": {
        "title": "Limitations",
        "content": "These formulas do not account for muscle mass, bone density, age, or ethnicity. Athletes or muscular individuals may have a higher 'ideal' weight. Always consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice."

  "faq": {
    "accuracy": {
      "question": "How accurate is the ideal weight calculator?",
      "answer": "Our calculator uses four scientifically validated formulas to provide a range of ideal weights. However, ideal weight varies based on factors like muscle mass, bone density, and body composition that these formulas cannot account for. Use the results as a general guideline."
    },
    "whichFormula": {
      "question": "Which formula should I use?",
      "answer": "The Devine formula is most commonly used in medical settings. However, we recommend looking at the average of all formulas and the BMI-based range for the most balanced view of your ideal weight."
    },
    "age": {
      "question": "Does age affect ideal weight?",
      "answer": "These traditional formulas do not directly factor in age. However, body composition naturally changes with age. Older adults may benefit from maintaining a slightly higher weight for better health outcomes."
    },
    "range": {
      "question": "How is the healthy weight range calculated?",
      "answer": "The healthy weight range is based on BMI values between 18.5 and 24.9, which are considered normal by the World Health Organization (WHO)."
    },
    "outsideRange": {
      "question": "What if my weight is outside the ideal range?",
      "answer": "If your current weight differs significantly from the calculated ideal, consult a healthcare provider before making major changes. Gradual changes of 0.5-1 kg per week are generally considered safe."

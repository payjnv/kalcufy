        "title": "What is Compound Interest?",
        "content": "Compound interest is interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Unlike simple interest, which only earns on the principal, compound interest allows your money to grow exponentially over time."
      },

        "title": "The Power of Compounding",
        "content": "Albert Einstein reportedly called compound interest the 'eighth wonder of the world.' The longer your money compounds, the more dramatic the growth. Starting early, even with small amounts, can lead to significantly larger outcomes than starting late with larger amounts."

      "formula": {
        "title": "The Compound Interest Formula",
        "content": "The basic formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is principal, r is annual rate, n is compounding frequency, and t is time in years. For regular contributions, we use the future value of annuity formula."
      },
      "frequency": {
        "title": "Compounding Frequency Matters",
        "content": "More frequent compounding leads to slightly higher returns. Daily compounding earns more than monthly, which earns more than annually. However, the difference becomes smaller at lower interest rates and shorter time periods."

  "faq": {
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between APR and APY?",
        "answer": "APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the simple interest rate without compounding. APY (Annual Percentage Yield) includes the effect of compounding and represents your actual annual return. APY is always equal to or higher than APR."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does compounding frequency affect my returns?",
        "answer": "More frequent compounding means interest is calculated and added to your balance more often, allowing you to earn interest on interest sooner. At 7% annual rate, daily compounding yields about 0.25% more than annual compounding."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I contribute at the beginning or end of each period?",
        "answer": "Contributing at the beginning of each period earns slightly more because that money has an extra period to compound. The difference is usually small but adds up over long time periods."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's a realistic rate of return to expect?",
        "answer": "Historical stock market returns average around 7-10% annually after inflation. Bond returns are typically 2-4%. Savings accounts offer 0.5-5% depending on conditions. Be conservative in projections and remember past performance doesn't guarantee future results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I maximize compound interest?",
        "answer": "Start early to give your money more time to grow. Contribute regularly, even small amounts. Choose investments with higher returns (accepting more risk). Minimize fees that eat into returns. Reinvest dividends and interest."

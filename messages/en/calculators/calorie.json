        "title": "What is BMR?",
        "content": "Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories your body needs to maintain basic functions like breathing, circulation, and cell production while at complete rest. It typically accounts for 60-70% of your total daily energy expenditure."
      },
      {
        "title": "What is TDEE?",
        "content": "Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the total number of calories you burn in a day, including all activities. It's calculated by multiplying your BMR by an activity factor based on your lifestyle and exercise habits."
      },
      {
        "title": "Calorie Deficit and Surplus",
        "content": "To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than your TDEE (calorie deficit). To gain weight or build muscle, you need to consume more (calorie surplus). A deficit or surplus of 500 calories per day typically results in about 0.5 kg (1 lb) of weight change per week."
      },
      {
        "title": "Macronutrient Balance",
        "content": "Beyond total calories, the balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fats matters for health and body composition. Protein is essential for muscle maintenance and repair, carbohydrates provide energy, and fats support hormone production and nutrient absorption."

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How accurate is this calorie calculator?",
        "answer": "This calculator uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, which is considered one of the most accurate formulas for estimating BMR. However, individual metabolism can vary by up to 10-15%, so use these numbers as a starting point and adjust based on your results."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many calories should I eat to lose weight?",
        "answer": "For safe and sustainable weight loss, aim for a deficit of 500-750 calories below your TDEE. This typically results in losing 0.5-0.75 kg (1-1.5 lbs) per week. Avoid extremely low-calorie diets as they can be counterproductive and unhealthy."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I eat back calories burned from exercise?",
        "answer": "It depends on your goals. If your activity level is already factored into your TDEE calculation, you generally don't need to eat back exercise calories. However, if you do intense workouts, you may need additional fuel."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is protein important for weight loss?",
        "answer": "Protein helps preserve muscle mass during weight loss, keeps you feeling full longer, and has a higher thermic effect (burns more calories during digestion). Aim for 1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of body weight when trying to lose fat."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I recalculate my calories?",
        "answer": "Recalculate every 4-6 weeks or whenever you lose or gain significant weight (5+ kg). As your weight changes, so do your calorie needs. Also recalculate if your activity level changes substantially."

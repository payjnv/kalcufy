    {
      "question": "How much of a caloric deficit is too much?",
      "answer": "Don't go below 1200 calories (women) or 1500 calories (men) without medical supervision. Deficits larger than 1000 calories/day can trigger metabolic adaptation and muscle loss."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why am I not losing weight in a deficit?",
      "answer": "Common reasons include underestimating food intake, overestimating exercise calories, water retention, or metabolic adaptation. Track accurately for 2-3 weeks before adjusting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I eat back exercise calories?",
      "answer": "If you're at a moderate deficit (500 cal), eating back half your exercise calories prevents excessive restriction. Listen to your hunger signals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I break a weight loss plateau?",
      "answer": "Try recalculating TDEE at your new weight, take a diet break at maintenance, increase protein, change your exercise routine, or slightly adjust your deficit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it better to cut carbs or fat?",
      "answer": "For weight loss, total calories matter most. Keep protein high (0.7-1g per pound), then adjust carbs and fats based on preference and energy needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the TDEE calculation?",
      "answer": "TDEE formulas estimate within 10-15% for most people. Use it as a starting point, then adjust based on real-world results over 2-4 weeks."

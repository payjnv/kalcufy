    "sections": [
      {
        "title": "The Science of Pacing",
        "content": "Your running pace is determined by your aerobic capacity (VO2max), lactate threshold, and running economy. The VDOT system combines these factors into a single score that predicts performance across distances."
      },
      {
        "title": "Training by Pace",
        "content": "Different training paces target different physiological systems. Easy runs at 65-75% effort build mitochondria and capillaries. Tempo runs at 85-90% effort improve your lactate threshold. Intervals at 95-100% effort boost your VO2max."

      {
        "title": "Race Day Strategy",
        "content": "The key to successful racing is even or negative splits. Starting too fast leads to glycogen depletion and muscle fatigue. Use the first miles to settle into rhythm, then gradually increase effort in the final third."

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How accurate are race time predictions?",
      "answer": "Predictions are most accurate when based on recent race times (within 4-6 weeks) at distances close to your goal race. A 10K time predicts a half marathon better than it predicts a marathon."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's a good VDOT score?",
      "answer": "VDOT scores typically range from 30 (beginner) to 85 (elite). A recreational runner might score 35-45, a competitive amateur 50-60, and elite runners 70+."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does heat affect my pace?",
      "answer": "Research shows performance decreases 1.5-3% for every 10°F above 55°F. At 85°F with high humidity, expect to run 6-12% slower than cool weather."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I train by pace or heart rate?",
      "answer": "Both have value. Pace is better for track workouts and races. Heart rate is useful for easy runs, especially in heat or when fatigued, as it accounts for daily variations in fitness."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I improve my VDOT score?",
      "answer": "Consistent training with proper periodization improves VDOT 2-5 points per year for newer runners. Key workouts include tempo runs, VO2max intervals, and long runs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What pace should I run my long runs?",
      "answer": "Long runs should be at easy pace, typically 1-2 minutes per mile slower than marathon pace. You should be able to hold a conversation throughout."

    {
      "question": "What is TDEE?",
      "answer": "TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is the total number of calories you burn each day. It includes your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), the calories burned through physical activity, and the thermic effect of food (energy used to digest food)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is TDEE different from BMR?",
      "answer": "BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is the calories your body burns at complete rest just to maintain vital functions. TDEE adds your activity level on top of BMR, giving you the total calories you burn in a day including exercise and daily activities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate is the TDEE calculation?",
      "answer": "TDEE calculations are estimates based on formulas. Actual energy expenditure varies based on genetics, muscle mass, hormones, and other factors. Use your calculated TDEE as a starting point and adjust based on real-world results over 2-4 weeks."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I use TDEE for weight loss?",
      "answer": "To lose weight, eat fewer calories than your TDEE. A deficit of 500 calories per day typically results in about 1 pound of weight loss per week. Don't go below 1,200 calories (women) or 1,500 calories (men) without medical supervision."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I use TDEE for muscle gain?",
      "answer": "To build muscle, eat slightly more than your TDEE (a surplus of 250-500 calories) while following a strength training program. This provides the extra energy needed for muscle growth while minimizing fat gain."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does pregnancy affect TDEE?",
      "answer": "Pregnancy increases calorie needs to support fetal growth and development. The 2nd trimester requires about 340 extra calories, and the 3rd trimester requires about 450 extra calories. Always consult your healthcare provider for personalized advice."

        "title": "Heart Rate Variability",

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why is my heart rate high on easy runs?",
      "answer": "Several factors elevate heart rate: heat, humidity, dehydration, caffeine, poor sleep, stress, or incomplete recovery. If consistently high, take extra recovery days or reduce training load."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the 220-age formula accurate?",
      "answer": "It's a rough estimate with standard deviation of 10-12 bpm. For precise training, test your actual max HR or use recent race data to calibrate your zones."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long should I train in each zone?",
      "answer": "Zone 2: 45-180 minutes builds endurance. Zone 4: 10-30 total minutes improves threshold. Zone 5: 3-8 minutes total (in intervals) for VO2max. Zone 1: Use for warm-up, cool-down, and recovery days."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's heart rate reserve (HRR)?",
      "answer": "HRR is the difference between your max and resting heart rate. It represents your 'usable' heart rate range. The Karvonen formula uses HRR for more personalized training zones."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I train by heart rate or perceived effort?",
      "answer": "Use both together. Heart rate provides objective data, while perceived effort accounts for factors like heat and fatigue. Learn to correlate your feelings with heart rate data."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should I recalculate my zones?",
      "answer": "Recalculate every 3-6 months or after significant fitness changes. As fitness improves, resting heart rate typically decreases, shifting your zones slightly."
